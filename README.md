# PDFtoImage

## Overview
There are plenty of programs to handle PDF files but instead of downloading one I decided to use this opportunity as a programming exercise/new project.
During the process I used this tutorial [geeksforgeeks.org - Convert PDF to Image using Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-pdf-to-image-using-python/).
